# Building a LangChain-Based Intelligent Retrieval System with Neo4j and OpenAI

## Overview
Welcome to the LangChain project! This repository showcases an advanced application of LangChain, an open-source library for creating language models and performing various natural language processing tasks. This project focuses on integrating LangChain with other tools and libraries to create a comprehensive natural language understanding system.

## Project Structure
The LangChain project is structured as follows:
- **`main.py`**: The main script that initializes and runs the LangChain modules.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and setup instructions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
- **`scripts/`**: Directory containing auxiliary scripts and modules.
- **`data/`**: Directory for storing data used by the project.
- **`docs/`**: Directory for documentation files, including this `README.md`.

## Features
- **Integration with LangChain Core**: Utilizes core components like `ChatOpenAI` and `GraphTransformers` for natural language understanding and graph-based data representation.
- **Graph Database Integration**: Stores and queries data in Neo4j for efficient graph-based data operations.
- **Wikipedia Data Loading**: Loads and processes example data from Wikipedia for analysis.
- **Advanced Natural Language Processing**: Uses LangChain's capabilities for entity extraction, structured data retrieval, and answering complex questions.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Setup
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

Neo4j Database: Set up a Neo4j instance and configure the connection details in your environment variables.
OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it in your environment variables.
Set up your environment variables:

```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    export NEO4J_URI=<your-neo4j-uri>
    export NEO4J_USERNAME=<your-neo4j-username>
    export NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-neo4j-password>
```
